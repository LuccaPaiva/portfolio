# Letterboxd

This is a colab script in which I create a few diferent forms of visualizint the data about the movies I have seen. Watching movies is a passion of mine, and letterboxd is a plataform in which you can log the movies you have watched.  
For now, with my script I can process the list of movies I have watched, I update them in a gsheets, and use the data to create a few charts. The charts show movies I have watched by country and the languagues of these movies.


### Movies by country
