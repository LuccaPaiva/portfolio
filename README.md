Hello,
My name is Lucca Paiva, i'm currently a Computer Engeneering student at UNICAMP in Brazil. This is my repo to showcase a few of my projects.
Here are they:

1. [letterboxd](https://github.com/LuccaPaiva/portfolio/tree/main/letterboxd)


## Letterboxd

This is a colab script in which I create a few diferent forms of visualizint the data about the movies I have seen. Watching movies is a passion of mine, and [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) is a plataform in which you can log the movies you have watched.  
For now, with my script I can process the list of movies I have watched, I update them in a gsheets, and use the data to create a few charts. The charts show movies I have watched by country and the languagues of these movies.
